# Face Generation

## Project Overview

In this project, I defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. The goal of this project is to get a generator network to generate _new_ images of faces that look as realistic as possble. The image below is a result of the training:

## Project Instruction

### Instruction

1. Clone the repository and navigage to the downloaded folder.
	```
		git clone https://github.com/choonghee-lee/Face-Generation
		cd Face-Generation
	```
2. Open the `dlnd_face_generation.ipynb` file. Of course, you can find HTML version of the file.
	```
		jupyter notebook dlnd_face_generation.ipynb
	```
3. Read and follow the instructions! This repository does not include the dataset of faces. You can find and download it in the notebook.

### Libraries

The list below represents main libraries and its objects for the project.

### Accelerating the Training Process

In the training phase, it takes your time too much so I recommend you to use a GPU to train the dataset of faces.

### Amazon Web Services

You can use Amazon Web Services to launch an EC2 GPU instance. (This costs money!)
